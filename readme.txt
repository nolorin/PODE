The PHP Object-Data Encapsulation (PODE) toolkit is a set of classes and traits that increase the security and control of object-data handling in PHP programs. PODE is especially useful for multi-sourced platforms such as WordPress and Joomla, where the provenance of individual plugins is unknown and unverified to other plugin developers. PODE is also an effective additional layer of security for websites that handle sensitive client data, including ecommerce sites, because it allows the server to store sensitive information in session variables or in serialized form without exposing that data to theft in the event of a security breach. The toolkit also can be used to enhance and streamline development by enforcing powerful but adaptable type-casting filters and data permissions within code, which are beneficial features in large projects involving many developers with varying degrees of coordination.
